# Save each exercise in a separate file: ex-11-X.py, where
# X is replaced with 1, 2, 3, 4 etc

# Problems:

# 1) This program has several problems,
#    fix the errors! (remnove the # from the
#    code lines first) [filename: ex-11-1.py]
#
# print(Hello)
# something == input('enter something')
# print('you entered:' something)

# 2) fix this program the same way [filename: ex-11-2.py]:
#
# print('Hello!')
# something = inptu('Enter something: ')
# if something = 'hello':
#     print('Hello for you too!")
#
# elseif something='hi'
#     print('Hi there!')
# else:
#     print("I don't know what ' something 'means');
#

# 3) Write the following program and see what it does:
#       [filename: ex-11-3.py]
#
# greeting = 'Boo!'
# repeated = 5
# print( greeting * repeated )

# 4) Write a program that asks the user to enter a word,
# then prints the word 1000 times. [filename: ex-11-4.py]
#
# For example if the user enters 'hi', then the output
# would be hi hi hi hi hi hi hi ...

# 5) Make something that asks the user for two words,
# and prints them both out 1000 times with spaces
# between each. For example, if the user enters 'hi'
# and 'hello' then the output would be similar to
# this: hi hello hio hello hi hello hi hello hi hello...
#  [filename: ex-11-5.py]

# 6) Make a program that asks the user to enter a
# password. Whent he user enters 'PASSWORD' then the program
# will respond with "Welcome...". If the password is
# incorrect then the program responds "Access denied." and
# finally if nothing is entered then "You didn't
# enter anything" is displayed. [filename: ex-11-6.py]
